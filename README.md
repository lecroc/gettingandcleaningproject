# Getting and Cleaning Data Course project


This repo contains my class Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data class from Johns Hopkins University offered through Coursera.

The data project uses data collected from the accelerometers in Samsung Galaxy S smartphones.  30 subjects wore the phones while performing 6 activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying down. 

## Files Included

This repo contains four files.  This file will give an overview of the other three files and what you can find within them.  The other files inclueded are:

1) 

An R script named run_analysis.R that will pull in the raw data from the internet, select the required features, tidy names of the features and activities, and finally summarize the selected features by providing the mean value for each by subject and activity.

2) 

The resulting tidy data set called tidydata.txt

3)

A codebook called CodeBook.md that describes the data included in tidydata.txt
